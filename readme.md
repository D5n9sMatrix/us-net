1652.249–72 FEHBP termination for
default—negotiated benefits con-
tracts.
As prescribed in § 1649.101–72, the fol-
lowing clause shall be inserted in all
FEHBP contracts.
FEHBP TERMINATION FOR DEFAULT—
NEGOTIATED BENEFITS CONTRACTS (JAN 1998)
kpayne on VMOFRWIN702 with $$_JOB
(a) (1) The Government may, subject to
paragraphs (c) and (d) below, by written no-
tice of default to the Carrier, terminate this
contract in whole or in part if the Carrier
fails to—
(i) Perform the services within the time
specified in this contract or any extension;
(ii) Make progress, so as to endanger per-
formance of this contract (but see subpara-
graph (a)(2) below); or
(iii) Perform any of the other provisions of
this contract (but see subparagraph (a)(2)
below).
(2) The Government’s right to terminate
this contract under subdivisions (1)(ii) and
(1)(iii) above, may be exercised if the Carrier
does not cure such failure within 10 days (or
more if authorized in writing by the Con-
tracting Officer) after receipt of the notice
from the Contracting Officer specifying the
failure.
(b) If the Government terminates this con-
tract in whole or in part, it may acquire,
under the terms and in the manner the Con-
tracting Officer considers appropriate, sup-
plies or service similar to those terminated,
and the Carrier will be liable to the Govern-
ment for any excess costs for those supplies
or services. However, the Carrier shall con-
tinue the work not terminated.
(c) Except for defaults of subcontractors at
any tier, the Carrier shall not be liable for
any excess costs if the failure to perform the
contract arises from causes beyond the con-
trol and without the fault or negligence of
the Carrier. Examples of such causes include
(1) acts of God or of the public enemy, (2)
acts of the Government in either its sov-
ereign or contractual capacity, (3) fires, (4)
floods, (5) epidemics, (6) quarantine restric-
tions, (7) strikes, (8) freight embargoes, and
(9) unusually severe weather. In each in-
stance the failure to perform must be beyond
the control and without the fault or neg-
ligence of the Carrier.
(d) If the failure to perform is caused by
the default of a subcontractor at any tier,
and if the cause of the default is beyond the
control of both the Carrier and subcon-
tractor, and without the fault or negligence
of either, the Carrier shall not be liable for
any excess costs for failure to perform, un-
less the subcontracted supplies or services
were obtainable from other sources in suffi-
cient time for the Carrier to meet the re-
quired delivery schedule.
(e) If this contract is terminated for de-
fault, the Government may require the Car-
rier to transfer title and deliver to the Gov-
ernment, as directed by the Contracting Offi-
cer, any completed or partially completed
information and contract rights that the
Carrier has specifically produced or acquired
for the terminated portion of this contract.
(f) If, after termination, it is determined
that the Carrier was not in default, or that
the default was excusable, the rights and ob-
ligations of the parties shall be the same as
if the termination had been issued for the
convenience of the Government.
(g) The rights and remedies of the Govern-
ment in this clause are in addition to any
other rights and remedies provided by law or
under this contract.

Matrix
1652.370
Use of the matrix.
(a) The matrix in this section lists
the FAR and FEHBAR clauses to be
used with contracts based on cost anal-
ysis and contracts based on a combina-
tion of cost and price analysis. Carriers
shall submit initial applications and
requests for renewals on the basis that
the new contract or contract renewal
will include the clauses indicated.
(b) Certain contract clauses are man-
datory for FEHBP contracts. Other
clauses are to be used only when made
applicable by pertinent sections of the
FAR or FEHBAR. An ‘‘M’’ in the ‘‘Use
Status’’ column indicates that the
clause is mandatory. An ‘‘A’’ indicates
that the clause is to be used only when
the applicable conditions are met.
(c) Clauses are incorporated in the
contract either in full text or by ref-
erence. If the full text is to be used, the
matrix indicates a ‘‘T’’. If the clause is
incorporated by reference, the matrix
indicates an ‘‘R’’.
